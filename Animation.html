   <p>During the 2000s, flicking through the tv channnels I would stumble upon a new genre of entertainment called cartoons. I am pretty sure every child at the time experienced this as well.
   Of course my parents would have cartoons being played when I was a baby. However it was till I was 4 years old that I started to get really engaged in the shows I was watching.</p><p> Luckly we
   had Sky Tv which provided cartoons channels such as Cartoon Network and Nickeloden. Shows like <cite>Looney Tunes</cite>, <cite>Tom and Jerry</cite> and <cite>Ed Edd n Eddy</cite> blew my little mind back then, simiularly
   to gaming because at the time I was seeing moving characters on a CRT Tv along with the arrays of colours popping out on screen</p>

   <p>As mentioned, <cite>Ed Edd n Eddy</cite> was a animatied show I watch religiously. The main plot is that three kids tried to make or <q>scam</q> the neighbourhood kid's pocket money so they can buy
   candy called <b>Jaw Breakers</b>, the three main characters have the same name too. The big reason why I loved the show was its visual slapstick, comedic timing, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoXJEXdu2iE" target="_blank">jazzy background music</a> and
   with the cartoon world set in a neighbourhood, I found the characters relatable. I mean they were just regular kids like me.</p><p> Interesting enough it was one of last tv shows to be hand
   drawn. This means everything was done on paper as well as every background and character movement was hand drawn. The show stills holds ups, its timeless stories and its iconic
   animation was the perfect show for kids in the 2000s like me.</p>

   <section class = "CharacterDevelopment">
   <h2>Character Development</h2>
   <p>This is my favourite quote because it can be applied to anything like fitness, cooking or dancing. Its from a japanese animated show called <cite>Dragon Ball</cite> where in one episode, Master Roshi
   teaches his two pupils martial arts. In the span of a few episodes, I see the two pupils named <q>Goku</q> and <q>Krillin</q> getting stronger and working together dispite one of them hating the idea of training together. Even
   this sounds like a idea done before in other shows, but in 1986 not alot of shows had actual <em>character development</em>.</p><p> One thing I love when watching a long animated show is seeing how much
   you see the main character change from episode 1 to the finale. For me, it makes me grow attached to the characters. Animation does this type of storytelling in its 
   own way by showing more visual storytelling.</p><p> This means letting the audience piece or interpret what they are currently seeing on screen. Also it allows animaters to add more facial expressions
   to the characters which to compare to live action tv shows it might be more <b>difficult</b> for some actors and actresses.</p>
