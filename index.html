	<h3>At the start of the new millennium.</h3> 
	
	<p>I was born on <b>February 17th</b> in the year 2000. I am the youngest is my family which consits of five members, my parents and my two older brothers.
	As of now I am currently a Computer Scientist student in my college named the <a href = "https://www.wit.ie/" target="_blank">Waterford Institute of Technology</a>. Growing up in the 2000s was a special time for me as I got
	to see the rise of technology and the internet. According to my parents, I was quite a shy person when meeting new people especially in both pre-school and primary school. However I was very good at using technology.</p>
    <p>My Mam recalls a time where my Dad had trouble finding a tv channel on the tv remote. So I help him by tinkering away with the remote myself as I was always watching tv. My brothers taught me a lot of 
	good lessons growing up and protected me if I was in danger. I own them a lot because it was them who introduced me a lot of my favorites hobbies such a gaming and sports. As a 21 year old 
	now, I do miss the simpler times but I have learn to accept things the way they are. Having childhood memories is great and all, but you should explore what is out there and make more memories.</p>

	<p class = "secondparagraph">Yes I remember the times where Tv was my no.1 source of information but also a time to relax and watch some cartoons on the channel Cartoon Network.
	Or playing hundreds of hours on the Playstation 2 video game console or the Sega Mega Drive, speeding through levels of <cite>Sonic The Hedgehog 2</cite>.
	However I still enjoy other parts of my childhood that wasn't all tech. Such as playing outside in my neighbourhood with my cousin for a game of soccer or 
	playing Yu-Gi-Oh trading cards. As well as cycling to the local shop for a bag of jellies and a magnum ice-cream during the hot summers with not a care of the world.</p>
