   <p>Music to me is one of best things ever created. Everyday I listen to music to forget about the world for a little while, either hearing <cite>Wonderwall</cite> or <cite>Lucky Man</cite> for the millionth time.
   Nowadays I mostly listen to music during my home workouts or going outside for a walk. Spotify is my most frequent app I use on my phone. I really like how accessable the app is and the fact I can
   listen to millions of songs from around the world and discovering new artists along the way.</p><p> Back in the 2000s, my older brother would have to buy multiple CDs just to have a library to listen to.
   My Dad also has a massive collection of Vinyl records too. There are certain songs that gives me good memories. Such as hanging out with friends on a night out or remembering the music festivals I went to.</p>

   <p>I also love the music that used in movies, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" target="_blank">John Williams</a> made the theme songs of my favourite childhood films such as <cite>Harry Potter</cite> and <cite>Star Wars</cite>. Another film studio named Studio Ghibi from Japan have beautiful scores
   in their animated movies as well. Whenever I hear these movie scores, I feel like a kid again. In 2017 I discover three of my favorite bands, <cite>Oasis</cite>, <cite>Nirvana</cite> and <cite>Linkin Park</cite>.</p><p> Still to this day 
   I listen to their best tracks non-stop. Why? because they are brilliant thats why, in my opinion. A lot of songs from Oasis, even through they are from the 90s, I find timeless and relatable. Could be
   because the band members came from middle class neighbourhoods.</p>

   <p>These music bands inspires my creativity and actually led me to buy an acoustic guitar for myself. It was not expensive as it was beginner guitar but didn't felt cheap in a way. As it sounds  
   good when strumming the strings. I believe learning to play a guitar or any instrument is a good skill to learn. Its good for improving your memory when trying to play all the correct
   cords and beats.</p><p> Since its was my first time playing guitar, my fingers felt sore from pressing down on the strings. However after watching a <a href = "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-RYb_OMw7GfqsbipaR65GDDzA1rP5deq" target="_blank">tutorial playlist on Youtube</a> 
   by Andy Guitar, I can now play a couple songs. I had a smile on my face when I played <cite>Songbird</cite> by Oasis, felt great to have played the song perfectly.</p>
