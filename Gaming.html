	  <p>One of my earlist memories as a child was playing my first gaming device called the GameBoy Advance. The game I was playing was called <cite>Sonic Advance 3</cite>. To best describe it,
	  it had a colourful artstyle that drew me in along with the great music and short levels to play through to keep my young attention.</p> <p> To compare to watching a tv show, me <q>the player</q> got to
	  control a character on screen which blew my mind back. My brothers handed me down their gaming consoles such as the Playstation 2 and 
	  Sega Mega Drive. To this day <em>I still play video games.</em></p>

	  <p>As an adult, gaming is still my favourite hobby. With technology getting more bigger and faster, I get to play and immerse myself into beautiful worlds built on the lastest hardware and software. It is now more convient to 
	  download a game on my Playstation 5 then buying the actual disc, saving space and the need to travel to a game store. I wouldn't have meet any of my friends if it wasn't for gaming.</p> 
	  
	  <p>Playing online games with friends 
	  is a lot of fun and is so much better to socialise then the outside world. I am only <b>joking</b>. Learning how games are made is interesting because of the amount time and resources it takes to make a game. I 
	  like to collect art books of favourite games to see what the game director cut out from the offical release.</p>

	  <p>If I had to choose one of my favourite video games of all time it would have to be <cite>Undertale</cite>. It was developed by only one person named Toby Fox and the game's story was 6 hours long. However it has such an 
	  enriching world to explore, filled with interesting characters. Which a few I found quite relatable to me. The graphics was 2-D sprites but was beautiful in its own unique way. The gameplay lets you decide, 
	  <q>Fight or Mercy</q> which basically means you can kill the enemy or be passive.</p> <p>When I first choose to be passive on my first enemey, my main character became friends with the so called enemy which was 
	  not what I was expected at all. The soundtrack is amazing especially when the piano kicks in, giving me goosebumps. I would suggest to listen to the track <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz82xbLvK_k" target="_blank"><cite>Hopes and Dreams</cite></a>, 
	  it is my favourite <em>piece of music</em> ever made.</p>

	  <h2>“Undertale” Creator Toby Fox on the Indie Computer Game that’s Become an Industry Darling</h2>
	  <p>Toby Fox was twenty-three when he launched the Kickstarter campaign for Undertale with a modest goal of $5,000. 
	  The computer game, which would be almost entirely built, developed, and scored by Fox himself, had a relatively simple
	  premise — a child falls through a hole in a cave and arrives in a fantastical underground world...</p>
